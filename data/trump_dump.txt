Today I‘d like to share my thoughts about the stakes in this election.
People have asked me why I am running for President.
I have built an amazing business that I love and I get to work side-by-side with my children every day.
We come to work together and turn visions into reality.
We think big, and then we make it happen.
I love what I do, and I am grateful beyond words to the nation that has allowed me to do it.
So when people ask me why I am running, I quickly answer: I am running to give back to this country which has been so good to me.
When I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports, or the factories moving overseas to Mexico, or to other countries, I know these problems can all be fixed, but not by Hillary Clinton -- only by me.
The fact is, we can come back bigger and better and stronger than ever before --Jobs, jobs, jobs!
Everywhere I look, I see the possibilities of what our country could be. But we can't solve any of these problems by relying on the politicians who created them.
We will never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who rigged it in the first place.
The insiders wrote the rules of the game to keep themselves in power and in the money.
That's why we're asking Bernie Sanders' voters to join our movement: so together we can fix the system for ALL Americans. Importantly, this includes fixing all of our many disastrous trade deals.
Because it's not just the political system that's rigged. It's the whole economy.
It's rigged by big donors who want to keep down wages.
It's rigged by big businesses who want to leave our country, fire our workers, and sell their products back into the U.S. with absolutely no consequences for them.
It's rigged by bureaucrats who are trapping kids in failing schools.
It's rigged against you, the American people.
Hillary Clinton who, as most people know, is a world class liar --
just look at her pathetic email and server statements, or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack but the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers, a total self-serving lie.
Brian Williams' career was destroyed for saying far less.
Yesterday, she even tried to attack me and my many businesses.
But here is the bottom line: I started off in Brooklyn New York, not so long ago, with a small loan and built a business worth over 10 billion dollars.
I have always had a talent for building businesses and, importantly, creating jobs.
That is a talent our country desperately needs.
I am running for President to end the unfairness and to put you, the American worker, first.
We are going to put America First, and we are going to Make America Great again.
This election will decide whether we are ruled by the people, or by the politicians.
Here is my promise to the American voter:
If I am elected President, I will end the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C.
The other candidate in this race has spent her entire life making money for special interests -- and taking money from special interests.
Hillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and theft.
She ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund -- doing favors for oppressive regimes, and many others, in exchange for cash.
Then, when she left, she made $21.6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests -- in less than 2 years -- secret speeches that she does not want to reveal to the public.
Together, she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs, and foreign governments in the years since 2001.
They totally own her, and that will never change.
The choice in this election is a choice between taking our government back from the special interests, or surrendering our last scrap of independence to their total and complete control.
Those are the stakes.
Hillary Clinton wants to be President.
But she doesn't have the temperament, or, as Bernie Sanders' said, the judgement, to be president.
She believes she is entitled to the office.
Her campaign slogan is "I'm with her."
You know what my response to that is?
I'm with you: the American people.
She thinks it's all about her.
I know it's all about you -- I know it's all about making America Great Again for All Americans.
Our country lost its way when we stopped putting the American people first.
We got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism -- focusing on what's good for America's middle class -- to a policy of globalism, focusing on how to make money for large corporations who can move their wealth and workers to foreign countries all to the detriment of the American worker and the American economy.
We reward companies for offshoring, and we punish companies for doing business in America and keeping our workers employed.
This is not a rising tide that lifts all boats.
This is a wave of globalization that wipes out our middle class and our jobs.
We need to reform our economic system so that, once again, we can all succeed together, and America can become rich again.
That's what we mean by America First.
Our country will be better off when we start making our own products again, bringing our once great manufacturing capabilities back to our shores.
Our Founders understood this.
One of the first major bills signed by George Washington called for "the encouragement and protection of manufactur[ing]" in America.
Our first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned us by saying:
"The abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people."
I have visited the cities and towns across America and seen the devastation caused by the trade policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton.
Hillary Clinton supported Bill Clinton's disastrous NAFTA, just like she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization.
We've lost nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs since these two Hillary-backed agreements were signed.
Our trade deficit with China soared 40% during Hillary Clinton's time as Secretary of State -- a disgraceful performance for which she should not be congratulated, but rather scorned.
Then she let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property -- a crime which is continuing to this day.
Hillary Clinton gave China millions of our best jobs, and effectively let China completely rebuild itself.
In return, Hillary Clinton got rich!
The book Clinton Cash, by Peter Schweitzer, documents how Bill and Hillary used the State Department to enrich their family at America's expense.
She gets rich making you poor.
Here is a quote from the book: "At the center of US policy toward China was Hillary Clinton…at this critical time for US-china relations, Bill Clinton gave a number of speeches that were underwritten by the Chinese government and its supporters."
These funds were paid to the Clinton bank account while Hillary was negotiating with China on behalf of the United States.
She sold out our workers, and our country, for Beijing.
Hillary Clinton has also been the biggest promoter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will ship millions more of our jobs overseas -- and give up Congressional power to an international foreign commission.
Now, because I have pointed out why it would be such a disastrous deal, she is pretending that she is against it.
She has even deleted this record of total support from her book -- deletion is something she is very good at -- (at least 30,000 emails are missing.)
But this latest Clinton cover-up doesn't change anything: if she is elected president, she will adopt the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and we will lose millions of jobs and our economic independence for good.
She will do this, just as she has betrayed the American worker on trade at every single stage of her career -- and it will be even worse than the Clintons' NAFTA deal.
I want trade deals, but they have to be great for the United States and our workers.
We don't make great deals anymore, but we will once I become president.
It's not just our economy that's been corrupted, but our foreign policy too.
The Hillary Clinton foreign policy has cost America thousands of lives and trillions of dollars -- and unleashed ISIS across the world.
No Secretary of State has been more wrong, more often, and in more places than Hillary Clinton.
Her decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched.
Among the victims is our late Ambassador, Chris Stevens.
He was left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed -- that's right, when the phone rang at
3 o'clock in the morning, she was sleeping.
Ambassador Stevens and his staff in Libya made hundreds of requests for security.
Hillary Clinton's State Department refused them all.
She started the war that put him in Libya, denied him the security he asked for, then left him there to die.
To cover her tracks, Hillary lied about a video being the cause of his death.
Here is what one of the victim's mothers had to say:
"I want the whole world to know it: she lied to my face, and you don't want this person to be president."
In 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn in, it was a different world.
Libya was cooperating.
Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence.
Syria was under control.
Iran was being choked by sanctions.
Egypt was governed by a friendly regime that honored its peace treaty with Israel.
ISIS wasn't even on the map.
Fast forward to 2013: In just four years, Secretary Clinton managed to almost single-handedly destabilize the entire Middle East.
Her invasion of Libya handed the country over to the ISIS barbarians.
Thanks to Hillary Clinton, Iran is now the dominant Islamic power in the Middle East, and on the road to nuclear weapons.
Hillary Clinton's support for violent regime change in Syria has thrown the country into one of the bloodiest civil wars anyone has ever seen -- while giving ISIS a launching pad for terrorism against the West.
She helped force out a friendly regime in Egypt and replace it with the radical Muslim Brotherhood.
The Egyptian military has retaken control, but Clinton has opened the Pandora's box of radical Islam.
Then, there was the disastrous strategy of announcing our departure date from Iraq, handing large parts of the country over to ISIS killers.
ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made.
ISIS also threatens peaceful Muslims across the Middle East, and peaceful Muslims across the world, who have been terribly victimized by horrible brutality -- and who only want to raise their kids in peace and safety.
In short, Hillary Clinton's tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another.
It all started with her bad judgment in supporting the War in Iraq in the first place.
Though I was not in government service, I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started.
But Hillary Clinton learned nothing from Iraq, because when she got into power,
she couldn't wait to rush us off to war in Libya.
She lacks the temperament, the judgment and the competence to lead.
In the words of a Secret Service agent posted outside the Oval Office:
"She simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office…from the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true... Her leadership style -- volcanic, impulsive…disdainful of the rules set for everyone else -- hasn't changed a bit."
Perhaps the most terrifying thing about Hillary Clinton's foreign policy is that she refuses to acknowledge the threat posed by Radical Islam.
In fact, Hillary Clinton supports a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees coming into the United States, and that's an increase over President Obama's already very high number.
Under her plan, we would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on Earth -- with no way to screen who they are or what they believe.
Already, hundreds of recent immigrants and their children have been convicted of terrorist activity inside the U.S.
The father of the Orlando shooter was a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan, one of the most repressive anti-gay and anti-women regimes on Earth.
I only want to admit people who share our values and love our people.
Hillary Clinton wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death.
Maybe her motivation lies among the more than 1,000 foreign donations Hillary failed to disclose while at the State Department.
Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency.
Here is some more of what we learned from the book,
Clinton Cash:
A foreign telecom giant faced possible State Department sanctions for providing technology to Iran, and other oppressive regimes.
So what did this company do?
For the first time ever, they decided to pay Bill Clinton $750,000 for a single speech.
The Clintons got their cash, the telecom company escaped sanctions.
Hillary Clinton's State Department approved the transfer of 20% of America's uranium holdings to Russia, while 9 investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.
Hillary Clinton appointed a top donor to a national security board with top secret access -- even though he had no national security credentials.
Hillary Clinton accepted $58,000 in jewelry from the government of Brunei when she was Secretary of State -- plus millions more for her foundation.
The Sultan of Brunei has pushed oppressive Sharia law, including the punishment of death by stoning for being gay.
The government of Brunei also stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Hillary's Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she would absolutely approve if given the chance.
Hillary Clinton took up to $25 million from Saudi Arabia, where being gay is also punishable by death.
Hillary took millions from Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and many other countries that horribly abuse women and LGBT citizens.
To cover-up her corrupt dealings, Hillary Clinton illegally stashed her State Department emails on a private server.
Her server was easily hacked by foreign governments -- perhaps even by her financial backers in Communist China -- putting all of America in danger.
Then there are the 33,000 emails she deleted.
While we may not know what is in those deleted emails, our enemies probably do.
So they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be President of the United States.
This fact alone disqualifies her from the Presidency.
We can't hand over our government to someone whose deepest, darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies.
National security is also immigration security -- and Hillary wants neither.
Hillary Clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform in the history of the United States.
She has pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days, end virtually all immigration enforcement, and thus create totally open borders in the United States
The first victims of her radical policies will be poor African-American and Hispanic workers who need jobs.
They are the ones she will hurt the most.
Let me share with you a letter our campaign received from Mary Ann Mendoza.
She lost her amazing son, Police Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, after he was killed by an illegal immigrant because of the open borders policies supported by Hillary Clinton.
Sadly, the Mendoza family is just one of thousands who have suffered the same fate.
Here is an excerpt from Mrs. Mendoza's letter:
"Hillary Clinton, who already has the blood of so many on her hands, is now announcing that she is willing to put each and every one of our lives in harms' way -- an open door policy to criminals and terrorists to enter our country.
Hillary is not concerned about you or I, she is only concerned about the power the presidency would bring to her.
She needs to go to prison to pay for the crimes she has already committed against this country."
Hillary also wants to spend hundreds of billions to resettle Middle Eastern refugees in the United States, on top of the current record level of immigration.
For the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America.
Hillary's Wall Street immigration agenda will keep immigrant communities poor, and unemployed Americans out of work.
She can't claim to care about African-American and Hispanic workers when she wants to bring in millions of new low-wage workers to compete against them.
Here are a few things a Trump Administration will do for America in the first 100 days:
Appoint judges who will uphold the Constitution.
Hillary Clinton's radical judges will virtually abolish the 2nd amendment.
Change immigration rules to give unemployed Americans an opportunity to fill good-paying jobs
Stand up to countries that cheat on trade, of which there are many
Cancel rules and regulations that send jobs overseas
Lift restrictions on energy production
Repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare -- it is a disaster.
Pass massive tax reform to create millions of new jobs.
Impose tough new ethics rules to restore dignity to the Office of Secretary of State.
There is one common theme in all of these reforms.
It's going to be America First.
This is why the stakes in November are so great.
On election day, the politicians stand trial before the people.
The voters are the jury.
Their ballots are the verdict.
We don't need or want another Clinton or Obama.
Come November, the American people will have a chance to issue a verdict on the politicians that have sacrificed their security, betrayed their prosperity, and sold out their country.
They will have a chance to vote for a new agenda with big dreams, bold ideas and enormous possibilities for the American people.
Hillary Clinton's message is old and tired.
Her message is that can't change.
My message is that things have to change -- and this is our one chance do it.
This is our last chance to do it.
Americans are the people that tamed the West, that dug out the Panama Canal, that sent satellites across the solar system, that built the great dams, and so much more.
Then we started thinking small.
We stopped believing in what America could do, and became reliant on other countries, other people, and other institutions.
We lost our sense of purpose, and daring.
But that's not who we are.
Come this November, we can bring America back -- bigger and better, and stronger than ever.
We will build the greatest infrastructure on the planet earth -- the roads and railways and airports of tomorrow.
Our military will have the best technology and finest equipment -- we will bring it back all the way.
Massive new factories will come roaring into our country -- breathing life and hope into our communities.
Inner cities, which have been horribly abused by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party, will finally be rebuilt.
Construction is what I know -- nobody knows it better.
The real wages for our workers have not been raised for 18 years -- but these wages will start going up, along with the new jobs.
Hillary's massive taxation, regulation and open borders will destroy jobs and drive down wages for everyone.
We are also going to be supporting our police and law enforcement -- we can never forget the great job they do.
I am also going to appoint great Supreme Court Justices.
Our country is going to start working again.
People are going to start working again.
Parents are going to start dreaming big for their children again -- including parents in our inner cities.
Americans are going to start believing in the future or our country.
We are going to make America rich again.
We are going to make America safe again.
We are going to make America Great Again -- and Great Again For EVERYONE.
Thank you for joining me today.
This was going to be a speech on Hillary Clinton and how bad a President, especially in these times of Radical Islamic Terrorism, she would be.
Even her former Secret Service Agent, who has seen her under pressure and in times of stress, has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be president.
There will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and I will deliver that speech soon.
But today there is only one thing to discuss: the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders.
The attack on the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida, was the worst terrorist strike on our soil since September 11th, and the worst mass shooting in our country's history.
So many people dead, so many people gravely injured, so much carnage, such a disgrace.
The horror is beyond description.
The families of these wonderful people are totally devastated.
Likewise, our whole nation, and indeed the whole world, is devastated.
We express our deepest sympathies to the victims, the wounded, and their families.
We mourn, as one people, for our nation's loss -- and pledge our support to any and all who need it.
I would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of the attack.
Our nation stands together in solidarity with the members of Orlando's LGBT Community.
This is a very dark moment in America's history.
A radical Islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub not only because he wanted to kill Americans, but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation.
It is a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation.
It is an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives, love who they want and express their identity.
It is an attack on the right of every single American to live in peace and safety in their own country.
We need to respond to this attack on America as one united people -- with force, purpose and determination.
But the current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and think and act clearly.
If we don't get tough, and we don't get smart -- and fast -- we're not going to have a country anymore -- there will be nothing left.
The killer, whose name I will not use, or ever say, was born to Afghan parents who immigrated to the United States.
His father published support for the Afghan Taliban, a regime which murders those who don't share its radical views.
The father even said he was running for President of that country.
The bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in America in the first place was because we allowed his family to come here.
That is a fact, and it's a fact we need to talk about.
We have a dysfunctional immigration system which does not permit us to know who we let into our country, and it does not permit us to protect our citizens.
We have an incompetent administration, and if I am not elected President, that will not change over the next four years -- but it must change, and it must change now.
With fifty people dead, and dozens more wounded, we cannot afford to talk around the issue anymore -- we have to address it head on.
I called for a ban after San Bernardino, and was met with great scorn and anger but now, many are saying I was right to do so -- and although the pause is temporary, we must find out what is going on.
The ban will be lifted when we as a nation are in a position to properly and perfectly screen those people coming into our country.
The immigration laws of the United States give the President the power to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons that the President deems detrimental to the interests or security of the United States, as he deems appropriate.
I will use this power to protect the American people.
When I am elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we understand how to end these threats.
After a full, impartial and long overdue security assessment, we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of America.
We cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country, many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer.
Many of the principles of Radical Islam are incompatible with Western values and institutions.
Radical Islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and anti-American.
I refuse to allow America to become a place where gay people, Christian people, and Jewish people, are the targets of persecution and intimidation by Radical Islamic preachers of hate and violence.
It's not just a national security issue.
It is a quality of life issue.
If we want to protect the quality of life for all Americans -- women and children, gay and straight, Jews and Christians and all people -- then we need to tell the truth about Radical Islam.
We need to tell the truth, also, about how Radical Islam is coming to our shores.
We are importing Radical Islamic Terrorism into the West through a failed immigration system -- and through an intelligence community held back by our president.
Even our own FBI Director has admitted that we cannot effectively check the backgrounds of the people we are letting into America.
All of the September 11th hijackers were issued visas.
Large numbers of Somali refugees in Minnesota have tried to join ISIS.
The Boston Bombers came here through political asylum.
The male shooter in San Bernardino -- again, whose name I won't mention -- was the child of immigrants from Pakistan, and he brought his wife -- the other terrorist - from Saudi Arabia, through another one of our easily exploited visa programs.
Immigration from Afghanistan into the United States has increased nearly five-fold in just one year.
According to Pew Research, 99% of people in Afghanistan support oppressive Sharia Law.
We admit many more from other countries in the region who share these same oppressive views.
If we want to remain a free and open society, then we have to control our borders.
Yet, Hillary Clinton -- for months and despite so many attacks -- repeatedly refused to even say the words "radical Islam," until I challenged her yesterday to say the words or leave the race.
However, Hillary Clinton -- who has been forced to say the words today after policies she supports have caused us so much damage -- still has no clue what Radical Islam is, and won't speak honestly about what it is.
She is in total denial, and her continuing reluctance to ever name the enemy broadcasts weakness across the world.
In fact, just a few weeks before the San Bernardino slaughter, Hillary Clinton explained her refusal to say the words Radical Islam.
Here is what she said: "Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism."
Hillary Clinton says the solution is to ban guns.
They tried that in France, which has among the toughest gun laws in the world, and 130 were brutally murdered by Islamic terrorists in cold blood.
Her plan is to disarm law-abiding Americans, abolishing the 2nd amendment, and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns.
She wants to take away Americans' guns, then admit the very people who want to slaughter us.
I will be meeting with the NRA, which has given me their earliest endorsement in a Presidential race, to discuss how to ensure Americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror.
The bottom line is that Hillary supports the policies that bring the threat of Radical Islam into America, and allow it to grow overseas.
In fact, Hillary Clinton's catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more Radical Islamic immigration into this country, threatening not only our security but our way of life.
When it comes to Radical Islamic terrorism, ignorance is not bliss -- it's deadly.
The Obama Administration, with the support of Hillary Clinton and others, has also damaged our security by restraining our intelligence-gathering and failing to support law enforcement.
They have put political correctness above common sense, above your safety, and above all else.
I refuse to be politically correct.
I will do the right thing--I want to straighten things out and to Make America Great Again.
The days of deadly ignorance will end, and they will end soon.
As President I will give our intelligence community, law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks.
We need an intelligence-gathering system second to none.
That includes better cooperation between state, local and federal officials -- and with our allies.
I will have an Attorney General, a Director of National Intelligence, and a Secretary of Defense who will know how to fight the war on Radical Islamic Terrorism -- and who will have the support they require to get the job done.
We also must ensure the American people are provided the information they need to understand the threat.
The Senate Subcommittee on Immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the United States since September 11th.
Nearly a year ago, the Senate Subcommittee asked President Obama's Departments of Justice, State and Homeland Security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the United States.
These Departments refused to comply.
President Obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals implicated in terrorist activity of any kind since 9/11.
The public has a right to know how these people got here.
We have to screen applicants to know whether they are affiliated with, or support, radical groups and beliefs.
We have to control the amount of future immigration into this country to prevent large pockets of radicalization from forming inside America.
Even a single individual can be devastating, just look at what happened in Orlando.
Can you imagine large groups?
Truly, our President doesn't know what he is doing.
He has failed us, and failed us badly, and under his leadership, this situation will not get any better -- it will only get worse.
Each year, the United States permanently admits more than 100,000 immigrants from the Middle East, and many more from Muslim countries outside the Middle East.
Our government has been admitting ever-growing numbers, year after year, without any effective plan for our security.
In fact, Clinton's State Department was in charge of the admissions process for people applying to enter from overseas.
Having learned nothing from these attacks, she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan, including a 500% increase in Syrian refugees.
This could be a better, bigger version of the legendary Trojan Horse.
We can't let this happen.
Altogether, under the Clinton plan, you'd be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East with no system to vet them, or to prevent the radicalization of their children.
The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system to screen who we are bringing in.
The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian Americans.
The burden is also on Hillary Clinton to tell us how she will pay for it.
Her plan will cost Americans hundreds of billions of dollars long-term.
Wouldn't this money be better spent on rebuilding America for our current population, including the many poor people already living here?
We have to stop the tremendous flow of Syrian refugees into the United States -- we don't know who they are, they have no documentation, and we don't know what they're planning.
What I want is common sense.
I want a mainstream immigration policy that promotes American values.
That is the choice I put before the American people: a mainstream immigration policy designed to benefit America, or Hillary Clinton's radical immigration policy designed to benefit politically-correct special interests.
We've got to get smart, and tough, and vigilant, and we've got to do it now, because later is too late.
The media talks about "homegrown," terrorism, but Islamic radicalism, and the networks that nurture it, are imports from overseas.
Yes, there are many radicalized people already inside our country as a result of the poor policies of the past.
But the whole point is that it will be much, much easier to deal with our current problem if we don't keep on bringing in people who add to the problem.
For instance, the controversial Mosque attended by the Boston Bombers had as its founder an immigrant from overseas charged in an assassination plot.
This shooter in Orlando was the child of an immigrant father who supported one of the most repressive regimes on Earth.
Why would we admit people who support violent hatred?
Hillary Clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring Islamic extremists to our country who suppress women, gays and anyone who doesn't share their views.
She can't have it both ways.
She can't claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who want to oppress them.
How does this kind of immigration make our life better?
How does this kind of immigration make our country better?
Why does Hillary Clinton want to bring people here--in vast numbers--who reject our values?
Ask yourself, who is really the friend of women and the LGBT community, Donald Trump with his actions, or Hillary Clinton with her words?
Clinton wants to allow Radical Islamic terrorists to pour into our country--they enslave women, and murder gays.
I don't want them in our country.
Immigration is a privilege, and we should not let anyone into this country who doesn't support our communities -- all of our communities.
America has already admitted four times more immigrants than any country on earth, and we continue to admit millions more with no real checks or scrutiny.
Not surprisingly, wages for our workers haven't budged in many years.
So whether it's matter of national security, or financial security, we can't afford to keep on going like this.
We owe $19 trillion in debt, and no longer have options.
All our communities, from all backgrounds, are ready for some relief.
This is not an act of offense against anyone; it is an act of defense.
I want us all to work together, including in partnership with our Muslim communities.
But Muslim communities must cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad -- and they do know where they are.
I want to fix our schools, roads, bridges and job market.
I want every American to succeed.
Hillary Clinton wants to empty out the Treasury to bring people into the country that include individuals who preach hate against our own citizens.
I want to protect our citizens -- all of our citizens.
The terrorist attack on the Pulse Night Club demands a full and complete investigation into every aspect of the assault.
In San Bernardino, as an example, people knew what was going on, but they used the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting it.
We need to know what the killer discussed with his relatives, parents, friends and associates.
We need to know if he was affiliated with any radical Mosques or radical activists and what, if any, is their immigration status.
We need to know if he travelled anywhere, and who he travelled with.
We need to make sure every single last person involved in this plan -- including anyone who knew something but didn't tell us -- is brought to justice.
If it can be proven that somebody had information about any attack, and did not give this information to authorities, they must serve prison time .
America must do more -- much more -- to protect its citizens, especially people who are potential victims of crimes based on their backgrounds or sexual orientations.
It also means we must change our foreign policy.
The decision to overthrow the regime in Libya, then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in Syria, among other things, without plans for the day after, have created space for ISIS to expand and grow.
These actions, along with our disastrous Iran deal, have also reduced our ability to work in partnership with our Muslim allies in the region.
That is why our new goal must be to defeat Islamic terrorism, not nation-building.
For instance, the last major NATO mission was Hillary Clinton's war in Libya.
That mission helped unleash ISIS on a new continent.
I've said NATO needs to change its focus to stopping terrorism.
Since I've raised that criticism, NATO has since announced a new initiative focused on just that.
America must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against Islamic terrorism, just like we did against communism in the Cold War.
We've tried it President Obama's way.
He gave the world his apology tour, we got ISIS, and many other problems, in return.
I'd like to conclude my remarks today by again expressing our solidarity with the people of Orlando who have come under attack.
When I am President, I pledge to protect and defend all Americans who live inside of our borders.
Wherever they come from, wherever they were born, all Americans living here and following our laws will be protected.
America will be a tolerant and open society.
America will also be a safe society.
We will protect our borders at home.
We will defeat ISIS overseas.
We will ensure every parent can raise their children in peace and safety.
We will make America rich again.
We will make America safe again.
We will make American Great Again.
Thank you.
Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you, and thank you to the Center for National Interest for honoring me with this invitation.
It truly is a great honor.
I'd like to talk today about how to develop a new foreign policy direction for our country, one that replaces randomness with purpose, ideology with strategy, and chaos with peace.
It's time to shake the rust off America's foreign policy.
It's time to invite new voices and new visions into the fold, something we have to do.
The direction I will outline today will also return us to a timeless principle.
My foreign policy will always put the interests of the American people and American security above all else.
It has to be first.
Has to be.
That will be the foundation of every single decision that I will make.
America First will be the major and overriding theme of my administration.
But to chart our path forward, we must first briefly take a look back.
We have a lot to be proud of.
In the 1940s we saved the world.
The greatest generation beat back the Nazis and Japanese imperialists.
Then we saved the world again.
This time, from totalitarianism and communism.
The Cold War lasted for decades but, guess what, we won and we won big.
Democrats and Republicans working together got Mr. Gorbachev to heed the words of President Reagan, our great president, when he said, tear down this wall.
History will not forget what he did.
A very special man and president.
Unfortunately, after the Cold War our foreign policy veered badly off course.
We failed to develop a new vision for a new time.
In fact, as time went on, our foreign policy began to make less and less sense.
Logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance, which led to one foreign policy disaster after another.
They just kept coming and coming.
We went from mistakes in Iraq to Egypt to Libya, to President Obama's line in the sand in Syria.
Each of these actions have helped to throw the region into chaos and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper.
Very bad.
It all began with a dangerous idea that we could make western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interests in becoming a western democracy.
We tore up what institutions they had and then were surprised at what we unleashed.
Civil war, religious fanaticism, thousands of Americans and just killed be lives, lives, lives wasted.
Horribly wasted.
Many trillions of dollars were lost as a result.
The vacuum was created that ISIS would fill.
Iran, too, would rush in and fill that void much to their really unjust enrichment.
They have benefited so much, so sadly, for us.
Our foreign policy is a complete and total disaster.
No vision.
No purpose.
No direction.
No strategy.
Today I want to identify five main weaknesses in our foreign policy.
First, our resources are totally over extended.
President Obama has weakened our military by weakening our economy.
He's crippled us with wasteful spending, massive debt, low growth, a huge trade deficit and open borders.
Our manufacturing trade deficit with the world is now approaching $1 trillion a year.
We're rebuilding other countries while weakening our own.
Ending the theft of American jobs will give us resources we need to rebuild our military, which has to happen and regain our financial independence and strength.
I am the only person running for the presidency who understands this and this is a serious problem.
I'm the only one -- believe me, I know them all, I'm the only one who knows how to fix it.
Secondly, our allies are not paying their fair share, and I've been talking about this recently a lot.
Our allies must contribute toward their financial, political, and human costs, have to do it, of our tremendous security burden.
But many of them are simply not doing so.
They look at the United States as weak and forgiving and feel no obligation to honor their agreements with us.
In NATO, for instance, only 4 of 28 other member countries besides America, are spending the minimum required 2 percent of GDP on defense.
We have spent trillions of dollars over time on planes, missiles, ships, equipment, building up our military to provide a strong defense for Europe and Asia.
The countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense, and if not, the U.S. must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves.
We have no choice.
The whole world will be safer if our allies do their part to support our common defense and security.
A Trump administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and funded, and funded beautifully.
Thirdly, our friends are beginning to think they can't depend on us.
We've had a president who dislikes our friends and bows to our enemies, something that we've never seen before in the history of our country.
He negotiated a disastrous deal with Iran, and then we watched them ignore its terms even before the ink was dry.
Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon, cannot be allowed.
Remember that, cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.
And under a Trump administration, will never, ever be allowed to have that nuclear weapon.
All of this without even mentioning the humiliation of the United States with Iran's treatment of our ten captured sailors -- so vividly I remember that day.
In negotiation, you must be willing to walk.
The Iran deal, like so many of our worst agreements, is the result of not being willing to leave the table.
When the other side knows you're not going to walk, it becomes absolutely impossible to win -- you just can't win.
At the same time, your friends need to know that you will stick by the agreements that you have with them.
You've made that agreement, you have to stand by it and the world will be a better place.
President Obama gutted our missile defense program and then abandoned our missile defense plans with Poland and the Czech Republic.
He supported the ouster of a friendly regime in Egypt that had a longstanding peace treaty with Israel, and then helped bring the Muslim Brotherhood to power in its place.
Israel, our great friend and the one true democracy in the Middle East has been snubbed and criticized by an administration that lacks moral clarity.
Just a few days ago, Vice President Biden again criticized Israel, a force for justice and peace, for acting as an impatient peace area in the region.
President Obama has not been a friend to Israel.
He has treated Iran with tender love and care and made it a great power.
Iran has, indeed, become a great, great power in just a very short period of time, because of what we've done.
All of the expense and all at the expense of Israel, our allies in the region and very importantly, the United States itself.
We've picked fights with our oldest friends, and now they're starting to look elsewhere for help.
Remember that.
Not good.
Fourth, our rivals no longer respect us.
In fact, they're just as confused as our allies, but in an even bigger problem is they don't take us seriously anymore.
The truth is they don't respect us.
When President Obama landed in Cuba on Air Force One, no leader was there, nobody, to greet him.
Perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of Air Force One.
Then amazingly, the same thing happened in Saudi Arabia.
It's called no respect.
Absolutely no respect.
Do you remember when the president made a long and expensive trip to Copenhagen, Denmark, to get the Olympics for our country, and after this unprecedented effort, it was announced that the United States came in fourth -- fourth place?
The president of the United States making this trip -- unprecedented -- comes in fourth place.
He should have known the result before making such an embarrassing commitment.
We were laughed at all over the world, as we have been many, many times.
The list of humiliations go on and on and on.
President Obama watches helplessly as North Korea increases its aggression and expands further and further with its nuclear reach.
Our president has allowed China to continue its economic assault on American jobs and wealth, refusing to enforce trade deals and apply leverage on China necessary to rein in North Korea.
We have the leverage.
We have the power over China, economic power, and people don't understand it.
And with that economic power, we can rein in and we can get them to do what they have to do with North Korea, which is totally out of control.
He has even allowed China to steal government secrets with cyber attacks and engaged in industrial espionage against the United States and its companies.
We've let our rivals and challengers think they can get away with anything, and they do.
They do at will.
It always happens.
If President Obama's goal had been to weaken America, he could not have done a better job.
Finally, America no longer has a clear understanding of our foreign policy goals.
Since the end of the Cold War and the breakup of the Soviet Union, we've lacked a coherent foreign policy.
One day, we're bombing Libya and getting rid of a dictator to foster democracy for civilians.
The next day, we're watching the same civilians suffer while that country falls and absolutely falls apart.
Lives lost, massive moneys lost.
The world is a different place.
We're a humanitarian nation, but the legacy of the Obama-Clinton interventions will be weakness, confusion and disarray, a mess.
We've made the Middle East more unstable and chaotic than ever before.
We left Christians subject to intense persecution and even genocide.
We have done nothing to help the Christians, nothing, and we should always be ashamed for that, for that lack of action.
Our actions in Iraq, Libya and Syria have helped unleash ISIS, and we're in a war against radical Islam, but President Obama won't even name the enemy, and unless you name the enemy, you will never ever solve the problem.
Hillary Clinton also refuses to say the words radical Islam, even as she pushes for a massive increase in refugees coming into our country.
After Secretary Clinton's failed intervention in Libya, Islamic terrorists in Benghazi took down our consulate and killed our ambassador and three brave Americans.
Then, instead of taking charge that night, Hillary Clinton decided to go home and sleep.
Incredible.
Clinton blames it all on a video, an excuse that was a total lie, proven to be absolutely a total lie.
Our ambassador was murdered and our secretary of state misled the nation.
And, by the way, she was not awake to take that call at 3 o'clock in the morning.
And now ISIS is making millions and millions of dollars a week selling Libya oil.
And you know what?
We don't blockade, we don't bomb, we don't do anything about it.
It's almost as if our country doesn't even know what's happening, which could be a fact and could be true.
This will all change when I become president.
To our friends and allies, I say America is going to be strong again.
America is going to be reliable again.
It's going to be a great and reliable ally again.
It's going to be a friend again.
We're going to finally have a coherent foreign policy based upon American interests and the shared interests of our allies.
We're getting out of the nation-building business and instead focusing on creating stability in the world.
Our moments of greatest strength came when politics ended at the water's edge.
We need a new rational American foreign policy, informed by the best minds and supported by both parties, and it will be by both parties -- Democrats, Republicans, independents, everybody, as well as by our close allies.
This is how we won the Cold War and it's how we will win our new future struggles, which may be many, which may be complex, but we will win if I become president.
First, we need a long-term plan to halt the spread and reach of radical Islam.
Containing the spread of radical Islam must be a major foreign policy goal of the United States and indeed the world.
Events may require the use of military force, but it's also a philosophical struggle, like our long struggle in the Cold War.
In this, we're going to be working very closely with our allies in the Muslim world, all of which are at risk from radical Islamic violence, attacks and everything else.
It is a dangerous world, more dangerous now than it has ever been.
We should work -- thank you.
We should work together with any nation in the region that is threatened by the rise of radical Islam.
But this has to be a two-way street.
They must also be good to us.
Remember that.
They have to be good to us, no longer one way.
It's now two-way.
And remember, us and all we're doing, they have to appreciate what we've done to them.
We're going to help, but they have to appreciate what we've done for them.
The struggle against radical Islam also takes place in our homeland.
There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism.
For every case known to the public, there are dozens and dozens more.
We must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies.
We have no idea where these people are coming from.
There's no documentation.
There's no paperwork.
There's nothing.
We have to be smart.
We have to be vigilant.
A pause for reassessment will help us to prevent the next San Bernardino or frankly, much worse.
All you have to do is look at the World Trade Center and September 11th, one of the great catastrophes, in my opinion, the single greatest military catastrophe in the history of our country; worse than Pearl Harbor because you take a look at what's happened, and citizens were attacked, as opposed to the military being attacked -- one of the true great catastrophes.
And then there's ISIS.
I have a simple message for them.
Their days are numbered.
I won't tell them where and I won't tell them how.
We must we must as a nation be more unpredictable.
We are totally predictable.
We tell everything.
We're sending troops.
We tell them.
We're sending something else.
We have a news conference.
We have to be unpredictable.
And we have to be unpredictable starting now.
But they're going to be gone.
ISIS will be gone if I'm elected president.
And they'll be gone quickly.
They will be gone very, very quickly.
Secondly, we have to rebuild our military and our economy.
The Russians and Chinese have rapidly expanded their military capability, but look at what's happened to us.
Our nuclear weapons arsenal, our ultimate deterrent, has been allowed to atrophy and is desperately in need of modernization and renewal.
And it has to happen immediately.
Our active duty armed forces have shrunk from 2 million in 1991 to about 1.3 million today.
The Navy has shrunk from over 500 ships to 272 ships during this same period of time.
The Air Force is about one-third smaller than 1991.
Pilots flying B-52s in combat missions today.
These planes are older than virtually everybody in this room.
And what are we doing about this?
President Obama has proposed a 2017 defense budget that in real dollars, cuts nearly 25 percent from what we were spending in 2011.
Our military is depleted and we're asking our generals and military leaders to worry about global warming.
We will spend what we need to rebuild our military.
It is the cheapest, single investment we can make.
We will develop, build and purchase the best equipment known to mankind.
Our military dominance must be unquestioned, and I mean unquestioned, by anybody and everybody.
But we will look for savings and spend our money wisely.
In this time of mounting debt, right now we have so much debt that nobody even knows how to address the problem.
But I do.
No one dollar can be wasted.
Not one single dollar can we waste.
We're also going to have to change our trade, immigration and economic policies to make our economy strong again.
And to put Americans first again.
This will ensure that our own workers, right here in America, get the jobs and higher pay that will grow our tax revenues, increase our economic might as a nation, make us strong financially again.
So, so important.
We need to think smart about areas where our technological superiority, and nobody comes close, gives us an edge.
This includes 3D printing, artificial intelligence and cyber warfare.
A great country also takes care of its warriors.
Our commitment to them is absolute, and I mean absolute.
A Trump administration will give our servicemen and women the best equipment and support in the world when they serve and where they serve.
And the best care in the world when they return as veterans and they come back home to civilian life.
Our veterans have not been treated fairly or justly.
These are our great people and we must treat them fairly.
We must even treat them really, really well and that will happen under the Trump administration.
Finally, we must develop a foreign policy based on American interests.
Businesses do not succeed when they lose sight of their core interests and neither do countries.
Look at what happened in the 1990s.
Our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania -- and this was a horrible time for us -- were attacked.
And 17 brave sailors were killed on the U.S.S. Cole.
And what did we do?
It seemed we put more effort into adding China into the World Trade organization, which has been a total disaster for the United States.
Frankly, we spent more time on that than we did in stopping Al Qaeda.
We even had an opportunity to take out Osama bin Laden and we didn't do it
And then we got hit at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
Again, the worst attack on our country in its history.
Our foreign policy goals must be based on America's core national security interests.
And the following will be my priorities.
In the Middle East our goals must be, and I mean must be, to defeat terrorists and promote regional stability, not radical change.
We need to be clearsighted about the groups that will never be anything other than enemies.
And believe me, we have groups that no matter what you do, they will be the enemy.
We have to be smart enough to recognize who those groups are, who those people are, and not help them.
And we must only be generous to those that prove they are indeed our friends.
We desire to live peacefully and in friendship with Russia and China.
We have serious differences with these two nations, and must regard them with open eyes, but we are not bound to be adversaries.
We should seek common ground based on shared interests.
Russia, for instance, has also seen the horror of Islamic terrorism.
I believe an easing of tensions, and improved relations with Russia from a position of strength only is possible, absolutely possible.
Common sense says this cycle, this horrible cycle of hostility must end and ideally will end soon.
Good for both countries.
Some say the Russians won't be reasonable.
I intend to find out.
If we can't make a deal under my administration, a deal that's great -- not good, great -- for America, but also good for Russia, then we will quickly walk from the table.
It's as simple as that.
We're going to find out.
Fixing our relations with China is another important step -- and really toward creating an even more prosperous period of time.
China respects strength and by letting them take advantage of us economically, which they are doing like never before, we have lost all of their respect.
We have a massive trade deficit with China, a deficit that we have to find a way quickly, and I mean quickly, to balance.
A strong and smart America is an America that will find a better friend in China, better than we have right now.
Look at what China is doing in the South China Sea.
They're not supposed to be doing it.
A guide to following the remaining Republican primary contests like a political pro.
No respect for this country or this president.
We can both benefit or we can both go our separate ways.
If need be, that's what's going to have to happen.
After I'm elected president, I will also call for a summit with our NATO allies and a separate summit with our Asian allies.
In these summits, we will not only discuss a rebalancing of financial commitments, but take a fresh look at how we can adopt new strategies for tackling our common challenges.
For instance, we will discuss how we can upgrade NATO's outdated mission and structure, grown out of the Cold War to confront our shared challenges, including migration and Islamic terrorism.
I will not hesitate to deploy military force when there is no alternative.
But if America fights, it must only fight to win.
I will never sent our finest into battle unless necessary, and I mean absolutely necessary, and will only do so if we have a plan for victory with a capital V.
Our goal is peace and prosperity, not war and destruction.
The best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined, deliberate and consistent foreign policy.
With President Obama and Secretary Clinton we've had the exact opposite -- a reckless, rudderless and aimless foreign policy, one that has blazed the path of destruction in its wake.
After losing thousands of lives and spending trillions of dollars, we are in far worst shape in the Middle East than ever, ever before.
I challenge anyone to explain the strategic foreign policy vision of Obama/Clinton.
It has been a complete and total disaster.
I will also be prepared to deploy America's economic resources.
Financial leverage and sanctions can be very, very persuasive, but we need to use them selectively and with total determination.
Our power will be used if others do not play by the rules.
In other words, if they do not treat us fairly.
Our friends and enemies must know that if I draw a line in the sand, I will enforce that line in the sand.
Believe me.
However, unlike other candidates for the presidency, war and aggression will not be my first instinct.
You cannot have a foreign policy without diplomacy.
A superpower understands that caution and restraint are really truly signs of strength.
Although not in government service, I was totally against the war in Iraq, very proudly, saying for many years that it would destabilize the Middle East.
Sadly, I was correct, and the biggest beneficiary has been has been Iran, who is systematically taking over Iraq and gaining access to their very rich oil reserves, something it has wanted to do for decades.
And now, to top it off, we have ISIS.
My goal is to establish a foreign policy that will endure for several generations.
That's why I also look and have to look for talented experts with approaches and practical ideas, rather than surrounding myself with those who have perfect résumés but very little to brag about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war.
We have to look to new people.
We have to look to new people because many of the old people frankly don't know what they're doing, even though they may look awfully good writing in The New York Times or being watched on television.
Finally, I will work with our allies to reinvigorate Western values and institutions.
Instead of trying to spread universal values that not everybody shares or wants, we should understand that strengthening and promoting Western civilization and its accomplishments will do more to inspire positive reforms around the world than military interventions.
These are my goals as president.
I will seek a foreign policy that all Americans, whatever their party, can support, so important, and which our friends and allies will respect and totally welcome.
The world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends and when old friends become allies, that's what we want.
We want them to be our allies.
We want the world to be -- we want to bring peace to the world.
Too much destruction out there, too many destructive weapons.
The power of weaponry is the single biggest problem that we have today in the world.
To achieve these goals, Americans must have confidence in their country and its leadership.
Again, many Americans must wonder why we our politicians seem more interested in defending the borders of foreign countries than in defending their own.
Americans.
Americans must know that we're putting the American people first again on trade.
So true.
On trade, on immigration, on foreign policy.
The jobs, incomes and security of the American worker will always be my first priority.
No country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests first.
Both our friends and our enemies put their countries above ours and we, while being fair to them, must start doing the same.
We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism.
The nation-state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony.
I am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring America down and will never enter.
And under my administration, we will never enter America into any agreement that reduces our ability to control our own affairs.
NAFTA, as an example, has been a total disaster for the United States and has emptied our states -- literally emptied our states of our manufacturing and our jobs.
And I've just gotten to see it.
I've toured Pennsylvania.
I've toured New York.
I've toured so many of the states.
They have been cleaned out.
Their manufacturing is gone.
Never again, only the reverse -- and I have to say this strongly -- never again; only the reverse will happen.
We will keep our jobs and bring in new ones.
There will be consequences for the companies that leave the United States only to exploit it later.
They fire the people.
They take advantage of the United States.
There will be consequences for those companies.
Never again.
Under a Trump administration, no American citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the citizens of a foreign country.
I will view as president the world through the clear lens of American interests.
I will be America's greatest defender and most loyal champion.
We will not apologize for becoming successful again, but will instead embrace the unique heritage that makes us who we are.
The world is most peaceful and most prosperous when America is strongest.
America will continue and continue forever to play the role of peacemaker.
We will always help save lives and indeed humanity itself, but to play the role, we must make America strong again.
And always -- always, always, we must make, and we have to look at it from every angle, and we have no choice, we must make America respected again.
We must make America truly wealthy again.
And we must -- we have to and we will make America great again.
And if we do that -- and if we do that, perhaps this century can be the most peaceful and prosperous the world has ever, ever known.
Thank you very much, everybody.
I appreciate it.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Wow.
Whoa.
That is some group of people.
Thousands.
So nice, thank you very much.
That's really nice.
Thank you.
It's great to be at Trump Tower.
It's great to be in a wonderful city, New York.
And it's an honor to have everybody here.
This is beyond anybody's expectations.
There's been no crowd like this.
And, I can tell, some of the candidates, they went in.
They didn't know the air-conditioner didn't work.
They sweated like dogs.
They didn't know the room was too big, because they didn't have anybody there.
How are they going to beat ISIS?
I don't think it's gonna happen.
Our country is in serious trouble.
We don't have victories anymore.
We used to have victories, but we don't have them.
When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal?
They kill us.
I beat China all the time.
All the time.
When did we beat Japan at anything?
They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do?
When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo?
It doesn't exist, folks.
They beat us all the time.
When do we beat Mexico at the border?
They're laughing at us, at our stupidity.
And now they are beating us economically.
They are not our friend, believe me.
But they're killing us economically.
The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems.
Thank you.
It's true, and these are the best and the finest.
When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best.
They're not sending you.
They're not sending you.
They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us.
They're bringing drugs.
They're bringing crime.
They're rapists.
And some, I assume, are good people.
But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we're getting.
And it only makes common sense.
It only makes common sense.
They're sending us not the right people.
It's coming from more than Mexico.
It's coming from all over South and Latin America, and it's coming probably -- probably -- from the Middle East.
But we don't know.
Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening.
And it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast.
Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East.
They've become rich.
I'm in competition with them.
They just built a hotel in Syria.
Can you believe this?
They built a hotel.
When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest.
They don't have to pay interest, because they took the oil that, when we left Iraq, I said we should've taken.
So now ISIS has the oil, and what they don't have, Iran has.
And in 19 -- and I will tell you this, and I said it very strongly, years ago, I said -- and I love the military, and I want to have the strongest military that we've ever had, and we need it more now than ever.
But I said, "Don't hit Iraq," because you're going to totally destabilize the Middle East.
Iran is going to take over the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq.
Think of it.
Iran is taking over Iraq, and they're taking it over big league.
We spent $2 trillion in Iraq, $2 trillion.
We lost thousands of lives, thousands in Iraq.
We have wounded soldiers, who I love, I love -- they're great -- all over the place, thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers.
And we have nothing.
We can't even go there.
We have nothing.
And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it.
Last week, I read 2,300 Humvees -- these are big vehicles -- were left behind for the enemy.
2,000?
You would say maybe two, maybe four?
2,300 sophisticated vehicles, they ran, and the enemy took them.
You're right.
Last quarter, it was just announced our gross domestic product -- a sign of strength, right?
But not for us.
It was below zero.
Whoever heard of this?
It's never below zero.
Our labor participation rate was the worst since 1978.
But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate.
And our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent.
Don't believe the 5.6.
Don't believe it.
That's right.
A lot of people up there can't get jobs.
They can't get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs.
They all have jobs.
But the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because it's a statistic that's full of nonsense.
Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker.
Even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work.
It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old.
They don't know if it worked.
And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say,
That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue.
They don't know what they're doing.
They don't know what they're doing.
We have a disaster called the big lie: Obamacare.
Obamacare.
Yesterday, it came out that costs are going for people up 29, 39, 49, and even 55 percent, and deductibles are through the roof.
You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it's virtually useless.
It's virtually useless.
It is a disaster.
And remember the $5 billion Web site?
$5 billion we spent on a Web site, and to this day it doesn't work.
A $5 billion Web site.
I have so many Web sites, I have them all over the place.
I hire people, they do a Web site.
It costs me $3.
$5 billion Web site.
Well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action.
Nothing's gonna get done.
They will not bring us -- believe me -- to the promised land.
They will not.
As an example, I've been on the circuit making speeches, and I hear my fellow Republicans.
And they're wonderful people.
I like them.
They all want me to support them.
They don't know how to bring it about.
They come up to my office.
I'm meeting with three of them in the next week.
And they don't know
Are you running?
Are you not running?
Could we have your support?
What do we do?
How do we do it?
I like them.
And I hear their speeches.
And they don't talk jobs and they don't talk China.
When was the last time you heard China is killing us?
They're devaluing their currency to a level that you wouldn't believe.
It makes it impossible for our companies to compete, impossible.
They're killing us.
But you don't hear that from anybody else.
You don't hear it from anybody else.
And I watch the speeches.
Thank you.
I watch the speeches of these people, and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set, all sorts of wonderful things will happen.
What's going on?
I just want a job.
Just get me a job.
I don't need the rhetoric.
I want a job.
And that's what's happening.
And it's going to get worse, because remember, Obamacare really kicks in in '16, 2016.
Obama is going to be out playing golf.
He might be on one of my courses.
I would invite him, I actually would say.
I have the best courses in the world, so I'd say, you what, if he wants to -- I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac.
If he'd like to play, that's fine.
In fact, I'd love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing.
But Obamacare kicks in in 2016.
Really big league.
It is going to be amazingly destructive.
Doctors are quitting.
I have a friend who's a doctor, and he said to me the other day, Donald, I never saw anything like it.
I have more accountants than I have nurses.
It's a disaster.
My patients are beside themselves.
They had a plan that was good.
They have no plan now.
We have to repeal Obamacare, and it can be -- and -- and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody.
Let it be for everybody.
But much better and much less expensive for people and for the government.
And we can do it.
So I've watched the politicians.
I've dealt with them all my life.
If you can't make a good deal with a politician, then there's something wrong with you.
You're certainly not very good.
And that's what we have= representing us.
They will never make America great again.
They don't even have a chance.
They're controlled fully -- they're controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully.
Yes, they control them.
Hey, I have lobbyists.
I have to tell you.
I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me.
They're great.
But you know what?
It won't happen.
It won't happen.
Because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, it's destroying our country.
We have to stop, and it has to stop now.
Now, our country needs -- our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now.
We need a leader that wrote "The Art of the Deal."
We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets.
Our vets have been abandoned.
And we also need a cheerleader.
You know, when President Obama was elected, I said, Well, the one thing, I think he'll do well.
I think he'll be a great cheerleader for the country.
I think he'd be a great spirit.
He was vibrant.
He was young.
I really thought that he would be a great cheerleader.
He's not a leader.
That's true.
You're right about that.
But he wasn't a cheerleader.
He's actually a negative force.
He's been a negative force.
He wasn't a cheerleader; he was the opposite.
We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again.
It's not great again.
We need -- we need somebody -- we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again.
We can do that.
And, I will tell you, I love my life.
I have a wonderful family.
They're saying, "Dad, you're going to do something that's going to be so tough."
You know, all of my life, I've heard that a truly successful person, a really, really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office.
Just can't happen.
And yet that's the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again.
So ladies and gentlemen, I am officially running for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again.
It can happen.
Our country has tremendous potential.
We have tremendous people.
We have people that aren't working.
We have people that have no incentive to work.
But they're going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job.
And they'll be proud, and they'll love it, and they'll make much more than they would've ever made, and they'll be -- they'll be doing so well, and we're going to be thriving as a country, thriving.
It can happen.
I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.
I tell you that.
I'll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places.
I'll bring back our jobs, and I'll bring back our money.
Right now, think of this: We owe China $1.3 trillion.
We owe Japan more than that.
So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deal's even better.
How stupid are our leaders?
How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen?
How stupid are they?
I'm going to tell you -- thank you.
I'm going to tell you a couple of stories about trade, because I'm totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons.
Number one, the people negotiating don't have a clue.
Our president doesn't have a clue.
He's a bad negotiator.
He's the one that did Bergdahl.
We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there.
We get Bergdahl.
We get a traitor.
We get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us.
That's the negotiator we have.
Take a look at the deal he's making with Iran.
He makes that deal, Israel maybe won't exist very long.
It's a disaster, and we have to protect Israel.
So we need people -- I'm a free trader.
But the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you.
If you don't have talented people, if you don't have great leadership, if you don't have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible.
Free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people, but we have people that are stupid.
We have people that aren't smart.
And we have people that are controlled by special interests.
And it's just not going to work.
So, here's a couple of stories happened recently.
A friend of mine is a great manufacturer.
And, you know, China comes over and they dump all their stuff, and I buy it.
I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again.
But with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything -- everything, they got away with it again.
And it's impossible for our people here to compete.
So I want to tell you this story.
A friend of mine who's a great manufacturer, calls me up a few weeks ago.
He's very upset.
I said, "What's your problem?"
He said, "You know, I make great product."
And I said, "I know. I know that because I buy the product."
He said, I can't get it into China.
They won't accept it.
I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back.
They talked about environmental, they talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it.
I said, "Oh, wait a minute, that's terrible. Does anyone know this?"
He said, "Yeah, they do it all the time with other people."
I said, "They send it back?"
Yeah.
So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff.
They're not supposed to be doing that.
I told them.
Now, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things over there.
Ask Boeing.
They wanted Boeing's secrets.
They wanted their patents and all their secrets before they agreed to buy planes from Boeing.
Hey, I'm not saying they're stupid.
I like China.
I sell apartments for -- I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China.
Am I supposed to dislike them?
I own a big chunk of the Bank of America Building at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, that I got from China in a war.
Very valuable.
I love China.
The biggest bank in the world is from China.
You know where their United States headquarters is located? In this building, in Trump Tower.
I love China.
People say, "Oh, you don't like China?"
No, I love them.
But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we can't sustain ourself with that.
There's too much -- it's like -- it's like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team.
That's the difference between China's leaders and our leaders.
They are ripping us.
We are rebuilding China.
We're rebuilding many countries.
China, you go there now, roads, bridges, schools, you never saw anything like it.
They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes.
And they're all over the place.
We have all the cards, but we don't know how to use them.
We don't even know that we have the cards, because our leaders don't understand the game.
We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly.
Now they're going militarily.
They're building a military island in the middle of the South China sea.
A military island.
Now, our country could never do that because we'd have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldn't let our country -- we would never build in an ocean.
They built it in about one year, this massive military port.
They're building up their military to a point that is very scary.
You have a problem with ISIS.
You have a bigger problem with China.
And, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexico.
So this man tells me about the manufacturing.
I say, "That's a terrible story. I hate to hear it."
But I have another one, Ford.
So Mexico takes a company, a car company that was going to build in Tennessee, rips it out.
Everybody thought the deal was dead.
Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently.
Everybody thought it was a done deal.
It's going in and that's going to be it, going into Tennessee.
Great state, great people.
All of a sudden, at the last moment, this big car manufacturer, foreign, announces they're not going to Tennessee.
They're gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead.
Not good.
Now, Ford announces a few weeks ago that Ford is going to build a $2.5 billion car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in Mexico.
$2.5 billion, it's going to be one of the largest in the world.
Ford.
Good company.
So I announced that I'm running for president.
One of the early things I would do, probably before I even got in -- and I wouldn't even use -- you know, I have -- I know the smartest negotiators in the world.
I know the good ones.
I know the bad ones.
I know the overrated ones.
You get a lot of them that are overrated.
They're not good.
They think they are.
They get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed.
But they're not good.
But I know the negotiators in the world, and I put them one for each country.
Believe me, folks.
We will do very, very well, very, very well.
But I wouldn't even waste my time with this one.
I would call up the head of Ford, who I know.
If I was president, I'd say, Congratulations.
I understand that you're building a nice $2.5 billion car factory in Mexico and that you're going to take your cars and sell them to the United States zero tax, just flow them across the border.
And you say to yourself, "How does that help us," right?
How does that help us?
Where is that good?
It's not.
So I would say, Congratulations.
That's the good news.
Let me give you the bad news.
Every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we're going to charge you a 35-percent tax, and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction, and that's it.
Now, here's what is going to happen.
If it's not me in the position, it's one of these politicians that we're running against, you know, the 400 people that we're (inaudible).
And here's what's going to happen.
They're not so stupid.
They know it's not a good thing, and they may even be upset by it.
But then they're going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say, "You can't do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can't do that to Ford."
And guess what?
No problem.
They're going to build in Mexico.
They're going to take away thousands of jobs.
It's very bad for us.
So under President Trump, here's what would happen:
The head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news.
But it could be he'd want to be cool, and he'll wait until the next day.
You know, they want to be a little cool.
And he'll say, "Please, please, please."
He'll beg for a little while, and I'll say, "No interest."
Then he'll call all sorts of political people, and I'll say, "Sorry, fellas. No interest," because I don't need anybody's money.
It's nice.
I don't need anybody's money.
I'm using my own money.
I'm not using the lobbyists.
I'm not using donors.
I don't care.
I'm really rich.
And by the way, I'm not even saying that in a -- that's the kind of mindset, that's the kind of thinking you need for this country.
So -- because we got to make the country rich.
It sounds crass.
Somebody said, "Oh, that's crass."
It's not crass.
We got $18 trillion in debt.
We got nothing but problems.
We got a military that needs equipment all over the place.
We got nuclear weapons that are obsolete.
We've got nothing.
We've got Social Security that's going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn't bring money into the country.
All these other people want to cut the hell out of it.
I'm not going to cut it at all; I'm going to bring money in, and we're going to save it.
But here's what's going to happen:
After I'm called by 30 friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns, after I'm called by all of the special interests and by the -- the donors and by the lobbyists -- and they have zero chance at convincing me, zero -- I'll get a call the next day from the head of Ford.
He'll say. "Please reconsider," I'll say no.
He'll say, "Mr. President, we've decided to move the plant back to the United States, and we're not going to build it in Mexico."
That's it.
They have no choice.
They have no choice.
There are hundreds of things like that.
I'll give you another example.
Saudi Arabia, they make $1 billion a day.
$1 billion a day.
I love the Saudis.
Many are in this building.
They make a billion dollars a day.
Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships.
We say "we're gonna protect."
What are we doing?
They've got nothing but money.
If the right person asked them, they'd pay a fortune.
They wouldn't be there except for us.
And believe me, you look at the border with Yemen.
You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory.
Two weeks later, the place was blown up.
Everybody got out -- and they kept our equipment.
They always keep our equipment.
We ought to send used equipment, right?
They always keep our equipment.
We ought to send some real junk, because, frankly, it would be -- we ought to send our surplus.
We're always losing this gorgeous brand-new stuff.
But look at that border with Saudi Arabia.
Do you really think that these people are interested in Yemen?
Saudi Arabia without us is gone.
They're gone.
And I'm the one that made all of the right predictions about Iraq.
You know, all of these politicians that I'm running against now -- it's so nice to say I'm running as opposed to if I run, if I run.
I'm running.
But all of these politicians that I'm running against now, they're trying to disassociate.
I mean, you looked at Bush, it took him five days to answer the question on Iraq.
He couldn't answer the question.
He didn't know.
I said, "Is he intelligent?"
Then I looked at Rubio.
He was unable to answer the question, is Iraq a good thing or bad thing?
He didn't know.
He couldn't answer the question.
How are these people gonna lead us?
How are we gonna -- how are we gonna go back and make it great again?
We can't.
They don't have a clue.
They can't lead us.
They can't.
They can't even answer simple questions.
It was terrible.
But Saudi Arabia is in big, big trouble.
Now, thanks to fracking and other things, the oil is all over the place.
And I used to say it, there are ships at sea, and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cartel kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders.
They were smarter than our leaders.
There is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again.
Because we need money.
We're dying.
We're dying.
We need money.
We have to do it.
And we need the right people.
So Ford will come back.
They'll all come back.
And I will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that's based on competence.
Somebody said -- thank you, darlin'.
Somebody said to me the other day, a reporter, a very nice reporter, "But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person."
That's true.
But actually I am.
I think I am a nice person.
People that know me, like me.
Does my family like me?
I think so, right.
Look at my family.
I'm proud of my family.
By the way, speaking of my family, Melania, Barron, Kai, Donnie, Don, Vanessa, Tiffany, Evanka did a great job.
Did she do a great job?
Great.
Jared, Laura and Eric, I'm very proud of my family.
They're a great family.
I said, "I don't know."
I think that number one, I am a nice person.
I give a lot of money away to charities and other things.
I think I'm actually a very nice person.
But, I said, "This is going to be an election that's based on competence, because people are tired of these nice people.
And they're tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world.
And they're tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education.
And some of them are like third world countries.
But we're becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything.
So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what I'll do.
I'll do it.
Because a lot of people said, "He'll never run."
Number one, he won't want to give up his lifestyle.
They're right about that, but I'm doing it.
Number two, I'm a private company, so nobody knows what I'm worth.
And the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth.
So I said, "That's OK."
I'm proud of my net worth.
I've done an amazing job.
I started off -- thank you -- I started off in a small office with my father in Brooklyn and Queens, and my father said -- and I love my father.
I learned so much.
He was a great negotiator.
I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors.
But I learned a lot.
I gotta go into Manhattan.
I gotta build those big buildings.
I gotta do it, Dad.
I've gotta do it.
And after four or five years in Brooklyn, I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot of great deals -- the Grand Hyatt Hotel.
I was responsible for the convention center on the west side.
I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young.
And now I'm building all over the world, and I love what I'm doing.
So I said to myself, you know, nobody's ever going to know unless I run, because I'm really proud of my success.
I really am.
I've employed -- I've employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime.
That means medical.
That means education.
That means everything.
So a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it's big and complex, and they've put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary.
But everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don't extensions or anything.
We'll be filing it right on time.
We don't need anything.
And it was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said, "He had assets of $9 billion."
So I said, "No, that's the wrong number. That's the wrong number. Not assets."
So they put together this.
And before I say it, I have to say this.
I made it the old-fashioned way.
It's real estate.
You know, it's real estate.
It's labor, and it's unions good and some bad and lots of people that aren't in unions, and it's all over the place and building all over the world.
And I have assets -- big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected -- 9 billion 240 million dollars.
And I have liabilities of about $500 million.
That's long-term debt, very low interest rates.
In fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, "Donald, you don't have enough borrowings.
Could we loan you $4 billion"?
I don't need it.
I don't want it.
And I've been there.
I don't want it.
But in two seconds, they give me whatever I wanted.
So I have a total net worth, and now with the increase, it'll be well-over $10 billion.
But here, a total net worth of -- net worth, not assets, not -- a net worth, after all debt, after all expenses, the greatest assets -- Trump Tower, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Bank of America building in San Francisco, 40 Wall Street, sometimes referred to as the Trump building right opposite the New York -- many other places all over the world.
So the total is $8,737,540,00.
I'm not doing that to brag, because you know what?
I don't have to brag.
I don't have to, believe it or not.
I'm doing that to say that that's the kind of thinking our country needs.
We need that thinking.
We have the opposite thinking.
We have losers.
We have losers.
We have people that don't have it.
We have people that are morally corrupt.
We have people that are selling this country down the drain.
So I put together this statement, and the only reason I'm telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years -- you know, we're at $8 trillion now.
We're soon going to be at $20 trillion.
According to the economists -- who I'm not big believers in, but, nevertheless, this is what they're saying -- that $24 trillion -- we're very close -- that's the point of no return.
$24 trillion.
We will be there soon.
That's when we become Greece.
That's when we become a country that's unsalvageable.
And we're gonna be there very soon.
We're gonna be there very soon.
So, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly.
I would repeal and replace the big lie, Obamacare.
I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I'll build them very inexpensively, I will build a great, great wall on our southern border.
And I will have Mexico pay for that wall.
Mark my words.
Nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump.
Nobody.
I will find -- within our military, I will find the General Patton or I will find General MacArthur, I will find the right guy.
I will find the guy that's going to take that military and make it really work.
Nobody, nobody will be pushing us around.
I will stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons.
And we won't be using a man like Secretary Kerry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation, who's making a horrible and laughable deal, who's just being tapped along as they make weapons right now, and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old, and falls and breaks his leg.
I won't be doing that.
And I promise I will never be in a bicycle race.
That I can tell you.
I will immediately terminate President Obama's illegal executive order on immigration, immediately.
Fully support and back up the Second Amendment.
Now, it's very interesting.
Today I heard it.
Through stupidity, in a very, very hard core prison, interestingly named Clinton, two vicious murderers, two vicious people escaped, and nobody knows where they are.
And a woman was on television this morning, and she said, "You know, Mr. Trump,"
I said, "Very interesting."
So protect the Second Amendment.
End -- end Common Core.
Common Core should -- it is a disaster.
Bush is totally in favor of Common Core.
I don't see how he can possibly get the nomination.
He's weak on immigration.
He's in favor of Common Core.
How the hell can you vote for this guy?
You just can't do it.
We have to end -- education has to be local.
Rebuild the country's infrastructure.
Nobody can do that like me.
Believe me.
It will be done on time, on budget, way below cost, way below what anyone ever thought.
I look at the roads being built all over the country, and I say I can build those things for one-third.
What they do is unbelievable, how bad.
You know, we're building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, we're converting it into one of the world's great hotels.
It's gonna be the best hotel in Washington, D.C.
We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington.
The Obama administration.
We got it.
It was the most highly sought after -- or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services.
We got it.
People were shocked, Trump got it.
Well, I got it for two reasons.
Number one, we're really good.
Number two, we had a really good plan.
And I'll add in the third, we had a great financial statement.
Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job.
And they wanted to make sure it got built.
So we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports.
You come into La Guardia Airport, it's like we're in a third world country.
You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor.
They throw down asphalt, and they throw.
You look at these airports, we are like a third world country.
And I come in from China and I come in from Qatar and I come in from different places, and they have the most incredible airports in the world.
You come to back to this country and you have LAX, disaster.
You have all of these disastrous airports.
We have to rebuild our infrastructure.
Save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts.
Have to do it.
Get rid of the fraud.
Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it.
People have been paying it for years.
And now many of these candidates want to cut it.
You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that's being lost.
Renegotiate our foreign trade deals.
Reduce our $18 trillion in debt, because, believe me, we're in a bubble.
We have artificially low interest rates.
We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what's happening.
We have a stock market that is so bloated.
Be careful of a bubble because what you've seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens.
So be very, very careful.
And strengthen our military and take care of our vets.
So, so important.
Sadly, the American dream is dead.
But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
It is great to be here.
I'd like to thank Alumisource and all the amazing workers here for hosting us.
Today, I am going to talk about how to Make America Wealthy Again.
We are thirty miles from Steel City.
Pittsburgh played a central role in building our nation.
The legacy of Pennsylvania steelworkers lives in the bridges, railways and skyscrapers that make up our great American landscape.
But our workers' loyalty was repaid with betrayal.
Our politicians have aggressively pursued a policy of globalization -- moving our jobs, our wealth and our factories to Mexico and overseas.
Globalization has made the financial elite who donate to politicians very wealthy.
But it has left millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache.
When subsidized foreign steel is dumped into our markets, threatening our factories, the politicians do nothing.
For years, they watched on the sidelines as our jobs vanished and our communities were plunged into depression-level unemployment.
Many of these areas have still never recovered.
Our politicians took away from the people their means of making a living and supporting their families.
Skilled craftsmen and tradespeople and factory workers have seen the jobs they loved shipped thousands of miles away.
Many Pennsylvania towns once thriving and humming are now in a state despair.
This wave of globalization has wiped out our middle class.
It doesn't have to be this way.
We can turn it all around -- and we can turn it around fast.
But if we're going to deliver real change, we're going to have to reject the campaign of fear and intimidation being pushed by powerful corporations, media elites, and political dynasties.
The people who rigged the system for their benefit will do anything -- and say anything -- to keep things exactly as they are.
The people who rigged the system are supporting Hillary Clinton because they know as long as she is in charge nothing will ever change.
The inner cities will remain poor.
The factories will remain closed.
The borders will remain open.
The special interests will remain firmly in control.
Hillary Clinton and her friends in global finance want to scare America into thinking small -- and they want to scare the American people out of voting for a better future.
My campaign has the opposite message.
I want you to imagine how much better your life can be if we start believing in America again.
I want you to imagine how much better our future can be if we declare independence from the elites who've led us to one financial and foreign policy disaster after another.
Our friends in Britain recently voted to take back control of their economy, politics and borders.
I was on the right side of that issue -- with the people -- while Hillary, as always, stood with the elites, and both she and president Obama predicted that one wrong.
Now it's time for the American people to take back their future.
That's the choice we face.
We can either give in to Hillary Clinton's campaign of fear, or we can choose to Believe In America.
We lost our way when we stopped believing in our country.
America became the world's dominant economy by becoming the world's dominant producer.
The wealth this created was shared broadly, creating the biggest middle class the world had ever known.
But then America changed its policy from promoting development in America, to promoting development in other nations.
We allowed foreign countries to subsidize their goods, devalue their currencies, violate their agreements, and cheat in every way imaginable.
Trillions of our dollars and millions of our jobs flowed overseas as a result.
I have visited cities and towns across this country where a third or even half of manufacturing jobs have been wiped out in the last 20 years.
Today, we import nearly $800 billion more in goods than we export.
This is not some natural disaster.
It is politician-made disaster.
It is the consequence of a leadership class that worships globalism over Americanism.
This is a direct affront to our Founding Fathers, who wanted America to be strong, independent and free.
Our Founding Fathers Understood Trade
George Washington said that "the promotion of domestic manufactur[ing] will be among the first consequences to flow from an energetic government."
Alexander Hamilton spoke frequently of the "expediency of encouraging manufactur[ing] in the United States."
The first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that: "The abandonment of the protective policy by the American government… must produce want and ruin among our people."
Our original Constitution did not even have an income tax.
Instead, it had tariffs -- emphasizing taxation of foreign, not domestic, production.
Yet today, 240 years after the Revolution, we have turned things completely upside-down.
We tax and regulate and restrict our companies to death, then we allow foreign countries that cheat to export their goods to us tax-free.
As a result, we have become more dependent on foreign countries than ever before.
Ladies and Gentlemen, it's time to declare our economic independence once again.
That means reversing two of the worst legacies of the Clinton years.
America has lost nearly one-third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997 -- even as the country has increased its population by 50 million people.
At the center of this catastrophe are two trade deals pushed by Bill and Hillary Clinton.
First, the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.
Second, China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
NAFTA was the worst trade deal in history, and China's entrance into the World Trade Organization has enabled the greatest jobs theft in history.
It was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA in 1993, and Hillary Clinton who supported it.
It was also Bill Clinton who lobbied for China's disastrous entry into the World Trade Organization, and Hillary Clinton who backed that terrible agreement.
Then, as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton stood by idly while China cheated on its currency, added another trillion dollars to our trade deficits, and stole hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property.
The city of Pittsburgh, and the State of Pennsylvania, have lost one-third of their manufacturing jobs since the Clintons put China into the WTO.
Fifty thousand factories across America have shut their doors in that time.
Almost half of our entire manufacturing trade deficit in goods with the world is the result of trade with China.
It was also Hillary Clinton, as Secretary of State, who shoved us into a job-killing deal with South Korea in 2012.
As reported by the Economic Policy Institute in May, this deal doubled our trade deficit with South Korea and destroyed nearly 100,000 American jobs.
As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton "Voted for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of jobs."
Trade reform, and the negotiation of great trade deals, is the quickest way to bring our jobs back.
To understand why trade reform creates jobs, we need to understand how all nations grow and prosper.
Massive trade deficits subtract directly from our Gross Domestic Product.
From 1947 to 2001 -- a span of over five decades -- our inflation-adjusted gross domestic product grew at a rate of 3.5%.
However, since 2002 -- the year after we fully opened our markets to Chinese imports -- that GDP growth rate has been cut almost in half.
What does this mean for Americans?
For every one percent of GDP growth we fail to generate in any given year, we also fail to create over one million jobs.
America's "job creation deficit" due to slower growth since 2002 is well over 20 million jobs -- and that's just about the number of jobs our country needs right now to put America back to work at decent wages.
The Transpacific-Partnership is the greatest danger yet.
The TPP would be the death blow for American manufacturing.
It would give up all of our economic leverage to an international commission that would put the interests of foreign countries above our own.
It would further open our markets to aggressive currency cheaters.
It would make it easier for our trading competitors to ship cheap subsidized goods into U.S. markets -- while allowing foreign countries to continue putting barriers in front of our exports.
The TPP would lower tariffs on foreign cars, while leaving in place the foreign practices that keep American cars from being sold overseas.
The TPP even created a backdoor for China to supply car parts for automobiles made in Mexico.
The agreement would also force American workers to compete directly against workers from Vietnam, one of the lowest wage countries on Earth.
Not only will the TPP undermine our economy, but it will undermine our independence.
The TPP creates a new international commission that makes decisions the American people can't veto.
These commissions are great Hillary Clinton's Wall Street funders who can spend vast amounts of money to influence the outcomes.
It should be no surprise then that Hillary Clinton, according to Bloomberg, took a "leading part in drafting the Trans-Pacific Partnership".
She praised or pushed the TPP on 45 separate occasions, and even called it the "gold standard".
Hillary Clinton was totally for the TPP just a short while ago, but when she saw my stance, which is totally against, she was shamed into saying she would be against it too -- but have no doubt, she will immediately approve it if it is put before her, guaranteed.
She will do this just as she has betrayed American workers for Wall Street throughout her career.
Here's how it would go: she would make a small token change, declare the pact fixed, and ram it through.
That's why Hillary is now only saying she has problems with the TPP "in its current form," -- ensuring that she can rush to embrace it again at her earliest opportunity.
If the media doesn't believe me, I have a challenge for you.
Ask Hillary Clinton if she is willing to withdraw from the TPP her first day in office and unconditionally rule out its passage in any form.
There is no way to "fix" the TPP.
We need bilateral trade deals.
We do not need to enter into another massive international agreement that ties us up and binds us down.
A Trump Administration will change our failed trade policy -- quickly
Here are 7 steps I would pursue right away to bring back our jobs.
One: I am going to withdraw the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which has not yet been ratified.
Two: I'm going to appoint the toughest and smartest trade negotiators to fight on behalf of American workers.
Three: I'm going to direct the Secretary of Commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements a foreign country is currently using to harm our workers.
I will then direct all appropriate agencies to use every tool under American and international law to end these abuses.
Four: I'm going tell our NAFTA partners that I intend to immediately renegotiate the terms of that agreement to get a better deal for our workers.
And I don't mean just a little bit better, I mean a lot better.
If they do not agree to a renegotiation, then I will submit notice under Article 2205 of the NAFTA agreement that America intends to withdraw from the deal.
Five: I am going to instruct my Treasury Secretary to label China a currency manipulator.
Any country that devalues their currency in order to take advantage of the United States will be met with sharply
Six: I am going to instruct the U.S. Trade Representative to bring trade cases against China, both in this country and at the WTO.
China's unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance to the WTO, and I intend to enforce those rules.
Seven: If China does not stop its illegal activities, including its theft of American trade secrets, I will use every lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes, including the application of tariffs consistent with Section 201 and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 and Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.
President Reagan deployed similar trade measures when motorcycle and semiconductor imports threatened U.S. industry.
His tariff on Japanese motorcycles was 45% and his tariff to shield America's semiconductor industry was 100%.
Hillary Clinton, and her campaign of fear, will try to spread the lie that these actions will start a trade war.
She has it completely backwards.
Hillary Clinton unleashed a trade war against the American worker when she supported one terrible trade deal after another -- from NAFTA to China to South Korea.
A Trump Administration will end that war by getting a fair deal for the American people.
The era of economic surrender will finally be over.
A new era of prosperity will finally begin.
America will be independent once more.
Under a Trump Presidency, the American worker will finally have a President who will protect them and fight for them.
We will stand up to trade cheating anywhere and everywhere it threatens an American job.
We will make America the best place in the world to start a business, hire workers, and open a factory.
This includes massive tax reform to lift the crushing burdens on American workers and businesses.
We will also get rid of wasteful rules and regulations which are destroying our job creation capacity.
Many people think that these regulations are an even greater impediment than the fact that we are one of the highest taxed nations in the world.
We are also going to fully capture America's tremendous energy capacity.
This will create vast profits for our workers and begin reducing our deficit.
Hillary Clinton wants to shut down energy production and shut down the mines.
A Trump Administration will also ensure that we start using American steel for American infrastructure.
Just like the American steel from Pennsylvania that built the Empire State building.
It will be American steel that will fortify American's crumbling bridges.
It will be American steel that sends our skyscrapers soaring into the sky.
It will be American steel that rebuilds our inner cities.
It will be American hands that remake this country, and it will be American energy -- mined from American resources -- that powers this country.
It will be American workers who are hired to do the job.
We are going to put American-produced steel back into the backbone of our country.
This alone will create massive numbers of jobs.
On trade, on immigration, on foreign policy, we are going to put America First again.
We are going to make America wealthy again.
We are going to reject Hillary Clinton's politics of fear, futility, and incompetence.
We are going to embrace the possibilities of change.
It is time to believe in the future.
It is time to believe in each other.
It is time to Believe In America.
This Is How We Are Going To Make America Great Again -- For All Americans.
We Are Going To Make America Great Again For Everyone -- Greater Than Ever Before.
Thank you.
